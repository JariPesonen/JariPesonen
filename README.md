Hi, Iâ€™m @JariPesonen

Intention of this collection is to share solutions to some issues I have solved for myself, tested at some point, or otherwise found it 
useful to share. Hopefully you will find something useful for yourself.

I'm interested about security, automation, computer forensics and home automation and will sanitize and clean up code from my private 
repositories over time and add here.
